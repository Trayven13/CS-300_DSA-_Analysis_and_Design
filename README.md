# CS-300_DSA-_Analysis_and_Design

What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?

    For project one and two we are given a scenario: The academic advisors in the computer Science department at ABCU
    need a program that will 1. Print a list of all the computer science courses in alphanumeric order. 2. For a given 
    course, print out its title and prerequisites.

How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.

    I approached the problem by first creating psuedocode to outline the program. This included outlining the functions and 
    varabiles needed as well as the type of structure that will be used within the program. 
    Then after completing a runtime analysis on three different structures (Vector, Hash Table, and Binary Search Tree) I choose
    to use a Hash Table due to the speed of searching the table using its key.
  
How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?

    when happening upon a roadbock I would first look to past assignments and zybooks to see if there would be an explanation or example
    of the issues that I or another has solved in the past. If that didn't work I would search for a simular issue on stack overflow. My
    last resort would be to ask copilot, with a grain of salt, this seemed most of the time to cause more problems than help.

How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

    In my opinion, I have learned how to block out my functions and variables better. I have always tried to put as little code 
    in the main function as possible other than calling the functions that had already been made. I learned if the code is readable, don't
    comment it. If you need a reference or the function is to convoluted and can not be optomized then, yes, comment it.
